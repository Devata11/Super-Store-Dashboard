# üìà Superstore Sales Analysis Dashboard

## üìù Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive business intelligence solution built on the popular **Superstore Sales Dataset**. The main objective is to transform raw sales data into actionable business insights through interactive dashboards and reports. The solution enables stakeholders to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), understand customer behavior, and identify opportunities for revenue growth and cost reduction across different regions and product categories.

## üìÇ Repository Structure
This repository contains all the necessary files to replicate and understand the analysis:

* `New Sample - Superstore Power BI.xls`: The original Excel file that serves as the data source. It is comprised of three related sheets:
    * `Orders.csv`: The primary transactional table, containing detailed information on every sale, including `Order ID`, `Sales`, `Profit`, `Quantity`, `Discount`, and `Customer Information`.
    * `Returns.csv`: A simple table that tracks returned `Order IDs`, crucial for analyzing return rates and their impact on profitability.
    * `People.csv`: A dimension table that links `Regional Managers` to their corresponding `Regions`, allowing for a performance analysis by manager.
* `Power BI Assignment.pbix`: The Power BI project file. This file contains the complete data model, including established relationships between the tables, Power Query steps for data cleaning, and all the visualizations and interactive elements of the dashboard.
* `Tableau Assignments.twb`: The Tableau workbook used to create detailed visualizations and reports.

## üìä Key Insights and KPIs
The dashboards were developed to answer critical business questions and track performance against key metrics. The analysis provides deep insights into:

* **Profitability by Sub-Category:** A detailed breakdown of profit margins across different product sub-categories, identifying top performers (e.g., `Copiers`, `Phones`) and underperforming areas (e.g., `Tables`, `Supplies`).
* **Regional Performance:** A geographical analysis of sales and profit, highlighting the best-performing regions (e.g., `West`, `East`) and those requiring strategic focus.
* **Customer Segmentation:** An exploration of sales and profit distribution across different customer segments (`Consumer`, `Corporate`, `Home Office`), revealing which segment is the most valuable.
* **Shipping Efficiency:** An analysis of `Ship Mode` and delivery times to identify potential bottlenecks and improve customer satisfaction.
* **Return Rate Analysis:** A cross-functional analysis of returns to identify products or regions with high return rates, which can inform inventory management and quality control.
